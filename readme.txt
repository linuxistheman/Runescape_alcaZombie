The steps to set up the bot are fairly easy. Follow the regular compilation methods.
The demo version is 1.8.

Name it alcaZombie.java

Here is a "vouche" from a moderator and contributor that my 1.8 release is clean. [QUOTE=wtf;7140303]V1.8 is clean. I don't know what that kid is on about.[/QUOTE]



The bot requires a bank set up with Super Strength(4), Super Attack(4), Monkfish and Varrock teletabs. Have anything short of these items will probably cause the script to not work. An enhanced excalibur is optional but is strongly recommended. You must start with your gear equipped (oh and unfortunately you must also use a Abyssal whip as a main weapon).

NOTE! :
-Please also ensure you have already entered the bank pin before you start the bot or else the bot will stumble on the bank pin.
-Have quick prayers set
-Have the items outlined below
-Have your gear and an ABYSSAL WHIP equipped
-Start the script at the south east of West Varrock bank or with a Varrock teletab.
-Put all the required items up at the top of the bank in the general tab(infinity)
-Have your varrock teleport location set at the middle of varrock (not the GE)




I am selling my public release of alcaZombie 2.0 which is flawless 

Please post in this forum with your email address and add me at dark...@hotmail.com
The first 10 people will buy for 5m and the price will increase by 5m per next 10 people. This is because I don't want to ruin the spot by allowing hoards and hoards of botters to camp there. That said, please do not publicly distribute this script.
I would also expect a vouche/proggy out of the people who have bought the script so the transaction process goes more smoothly for me in the future.

Note: YOU will be going first and there are no refunds although I will offer support for my script.
