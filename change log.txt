This is probably going to be my last "free" release. I'll get started on making a flawless script that'll cost a bit of rsgp. This is to 1) so i make some money for my work :O and 2) to stop tons and tons of free loaders.
I'll still probably fix things that affect functionality, but I won't be adding failsafes and whatnot.

v2.0: Public release of the flawless bot!
     -failsafes for multiple things such as banking, switching weapons, prayer etc.
     -moves around if the zombies weren't attacking (ie got stuck on another player)
     -flawless methods and fixed glitches in the 1.8 release
     -more efficient (changed some timings)
     -drops monkfish to pick items like effigies


[/code]If you want to mod your loot table because you have Soul split (and thus can stay there indefinitely)
replace the code within the loot() function with
[code]
itempickup(20667,"Vecna skull");
itempickup(1631,"Uncut dragonstone");
itempickup(384,"Raw shark");
itempickup(12158, "Gold charm");
itempickup(12163,"Blue charm");
itempickup(12160,"Crimson charm");
itempickup(12159,"Green charm");
itempickup(8781,"Teak plank");
itempickup(8779,"Oak plank");
itempickup(961,"Plank");
itempickup(7937,"Pure essence");
itempickup(565,"Blood rune");
itempickup(560,"Death rune");
itempickup(561,"Nature rune");
itempickup(562,"Chaos rune");
itempickup(564,"Cosmic rune");
[/code]Whatever you don't want to pick up (mind that you only have 8 slots for unstackables) put a // infront it. There is no need to put // around the unstackable items because they food will automatically be dropped to accomodate those rare drops.
